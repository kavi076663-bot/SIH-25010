## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<p>our project aim to design and develope the ai crop advisor application that give the personalized advice to small and marginal farmer.this application gives the advice to the farmer about soil type,weather condition,crop history.this application also explain the information to the former with understandable  language.help of this application the farmer can improve the crop yeild and reduce the input cost.it  is former friendly tool the give right advice at right time.this application also provide the market price of the crops.with the help of the price detail to increase the profit.this application also provide the voice support for low liteaterate user.

## Technical Approach
data collection(soil sensor,weather apis,crop history).
machine learning models like crop recommendation model,fertilizer optimization model.
application development:
      offline capability; it ensure the app work in offline

## Feasibility and Viability
It's possible to build a smart crop advisory system. The technology exists to create a simple mobile app that gives farmers advice. You can use data from weather APIs and other sources, and design the app to be easy for anyone to use, even with limited digital skills.
The project is worth doing. There is a great need for it among small farmers in India. The system would help them increase their income and protect the environment, making it a valuable and sustainable solution

## Impact and Benefits
impact: the ai crop advisory application has a deep impact by making farming more efficient,profitable and sustainable.it provide farmer with the knowledge and tool to over come traditional farming challenges
benifits:financial benifits(more money for farmer),environmental benfits(protect the land,clener farming),social benefit(improve life,better food supply)
